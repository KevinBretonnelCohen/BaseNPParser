# BaseNPParser
This repository contains a Perl module, a test driver for the module, and some test data.

To obtain the output of the Collins head parser, run this code on your data.  If it outputs a single word, that is 
the same as the output from the Collins head parser would be.  If it outputs more than one word, then take the rightmost
word from that output, and that is the same as the output from the Collins head parser would be.
